Cornell students can use this Chrome extension to easily access professors' Rate My Professor page directly from the Class Roster. This extension adds a button next to the names of all professors detected on a page and links to their RMP page.
Heroku cors-anywhere server handles adding Access-Control-Allow-Origin value to the header of the request sent to Rate My Professor. This personal server allows for ample requests to be fulfilled.
